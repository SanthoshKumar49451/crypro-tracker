WebSocket (Binance)-Live price/volume updates

WebSocket Integration:
Connects to Binanceâ€™s ticker stream:

bash
Copy
Edit
wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams=btcusdt@ticker/ethusdt@ticker/
Parses and dispatches:

price

24h % change

24h volume

 Why setInterval is unnecessary:
The Binance WebSocket stream provides live, push-based data.

Every time a tracked asset changes (e.g., price, 24h %), Binance sends an update.
